Taking the data of Covid-19 diagnoses, elective surgeries, and rankings of U.S. states based
on how many restrictions were imposed to prevent the spread of the disease, we uncover weekly
trends that indicated the comfort level of patients as they chose to return to - or avoid -
medical procedures. Data from 04/01/2019 to 07/08/2020.

Built with Holoviews+Bokeh, on Django framework.
